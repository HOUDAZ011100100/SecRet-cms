# Backend API Reference

VELORA exposes a Laravel Sanctum JSON API under `/api`. The backend is MongoDB-only and stores model relationships as Mongo ObjectId string values in API-facing fields.

## Authentication

Public endpoints:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Readiness check for MongoDB and Redis. |
| `POST` | `/api/register` | Register a participant or client account. |
| `POST` | `/api/login` | Login and receive a Sanctum bearer token. |

Authenticated requests use:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

All `/api/*` responses are JSON, including framework errors such as unauthenticated `401` responses. Clients may send `X-Request-Id`; safe values are echoed back, and otherwise the backend generates one. API responses include the security headers `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`.

Demo users after `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force`:

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@demo.local` | `password` |
| Organizer | `organisateur@demo.local` | `password` |
| Participant | `participant@demo.local` | `password` |
| Client | `client@demo.local` | `password` |

## Money and Dates

- Money is stored internally in integer cents (`amount_cents`, `ticket_price_cents`).
- API compatibility fields remain decimal-compatible strings or numbers, such as `amount` and `ticket_price`.
- Dates should be sent as ISO-8601 strings.
- Mongo stores dates as BSON dates through Laravel casts.

## Error Shape

Validation errors use Laravel's default `422` JSON response. Domain errors use:

```json
{
  "message": "Human readable error."
}
```

Login and registration are rate limited. Rate-limit responses use HTTP `429` with the same message envelope.

The OpenAPI contract in `openapi.yaml` documents the route inventory and main request/response schemas. It is intentionally frontend-facing; the generated class docs remain available for internal PHP implementation details.
